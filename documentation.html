    <h1>Movie API Documentation</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the documentation for the Movie API. 
       This API serves as the server-side component of the “movies” web application, providing users with access to information about various movies, directors, and genres. 
       Users can sign up, update their personal information, and manage a list of their favorite movies. 
       This API is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and follows REST architecture principles.</p>
